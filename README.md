# EDID Creator #

## Why this tool ##

So after working with several of the other available tools to edit and create
edid files I found most of them lacking. Many of them seem to think an edit area
with a bunch of hexadecimals is the way to make an easy to use interface. That
would work fine except many of the settings are either bit fields or not byte
aligned make them hard to work with. Given the about and that I had two of the
same model monitors with two different and both incorrect edid I needed
something to create a new override edid to use with Windows and Linux as well
for them.
